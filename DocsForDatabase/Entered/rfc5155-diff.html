&lt;    The server MUST include the NSEC3 RR that matches QNAME.  This NSEC3
&lt;    RR MUST NOT have the bits corresponding to either the QTYPE or CNAME
&lt;    set in its Type Bit Maps field.

&gt;   If the No Data Response is a result of an empty non-terminal derived 
&gt;   from an insecure delegation covered by an Opt-Out NSEC3 RR, the 
&gt;   closest provable encloser proof MUST be included in the response.  
&gt;   The included NSEC3 RR that covers the "next closer" name for the 
&gt;   delegation MUST have the Opt-Out flag set to one. 
&gt; 
&gt;   In all other cases, the server MUST include the NSEC3 RR that matches 
&gt;   QNAME.  This NSEC3 RR MUST NOT have the bits corresponding to either 
&gt;   the QTYPE or CNAME set in its Type Bit Maps field.

&lt;    The validator MUST verify that an NSEC3 RR that matches QNAME is
&lt;    present and that both the QTYPE and the CNAME type are not set in its
&lt;    Type Bit Maps field.
&lt; 
&lt;    Note that this test also covers the case where the NSEC3 RR exists
&lt;    because it corresponds to an empty non-terminal, in which case the
&lt;    NSEC3 RR will have an empty Type Bit Maps field.

&gt;   If there is an NSEC3 RR that matches QNAME present, the validator must 
&gt;   check that both the QTYPE and the CNAME type are not set in its Type 
&gt;   Bit Maps field.
&gt; 
&gt;   Note that this test also covers the case where the NSEC3 RR exists
&gt;   because it corresponds to an empty non-terminal, in which case the
&gt;   NSEC3 RR will have an empty Type Bit Maps field.
&gt; 
&gt;   If there is no NSEC3 RR present that matches QNAME, then the validator 
&gt;   MUST verify a closest provable encloser proof for the QNAME.  The 
&gt;   validator MUST verify that the Opt-Out bit is set in the NSEC3 RR that 
&gt;   covers the "next closer" name to the delegation name. This test covers 
&gt;   the case where the response is due to an Empty Non-Terminal derived 
&gt;   from an insecure delegation covered by an Opt-Out NSEC3 RR.</pre>
